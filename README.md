## Setup

Before running the `npm run test -- --watch` command, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

`npm -v`

If you get a version in response, it means that npm is installed correctly.

## Installing Dependencies

Before running the tests, you need to install the project dependencies. In the project root directory, execute the following command in the terminal:

`npm install`

This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running Tests

To run the tests and watch for file changes, use the following command in the terminal:

`npm run test -- --watch`

This will start the test execution and keep the watch mode enabled, so that tests will be re-executed whenever there are changes in the project files.
